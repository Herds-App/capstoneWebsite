				<div class="userManual text-center">
					<h1>User Manual</h1>
					<p>When opening Herds, the User will be prompted for their login information and if they do not have an account, there will be an option to register for one below. When registering for an account, the user will be prompted for their email address, phone number and password. This will ensure that the User’s information will remain secure and only accessible to them. Refresh and access tokens are also utilized so that once a User has logged in, they have the option to remain logged in, so they do not have to repeat the process above. The User’s profile will be public so anyone can see it, and the profile can contain whatever the User would like. For example, it will contain a profile picture, display name and username, organizations the User is a member of (Herds), as well as posts that the User has created.</p>
					<p>Once logged in, you will be moved to the home page where the User will be able to see different feeds, and these feeds are attached to different Herds that they are a member of. The User will be able to see their own posts within the feeds, as well as other Users that are a member of the same Herd. A User will be able to tell which Herd they are currently in by the white highlighted tab at the top of the page. To create a new post within a Herd, the User will simply press the plus button towards the top of the screen, giving a prompt to fill with their message. Before this post is sent, it will be moderated to ensure the content of the post is appropriate. The User also has the option to “like” a post if they enjoyed the content of the post and leave a comment on said post. </p>
					<p>If the User decides to click on the Herds tab, they will be able to see all the different Herds that they are a member of. When the User clicks on these Herds, it will open up a calendar, allowing them to see different events scheduled throughout the semester. This will range from University Herds, where it will show events the University is hosting, as well as Herds created by Students, where you will be able to see scheduled study hall hours, events, dress codes, RSVP for events and if necessary pay for events through the app. If the User happens to be the admin for a Herd, they will be able to add events to the calendar. Some Herds will be public and private, if public you would not need to be a member of the Herd to see posts and the calendar, however you would need to subscribe to the Herd and you would also not be able to create posts within that Herd or communicate via direct or group messaging within that Herd (Would also have the option to create a chat with members of the Herd, but would not be able to communicate directly in the Herd). If it is private, then you would need to be a member of the Herd to have access to what is listed above. In the Herds tab, if the User presses on the plus button they will be able to create a new Herd, and the name of it is up to the User’s preference. Once this new Herd is created, the User can then go back to the Home page where they will be able to see this new Herd highlighted in white at the top. Once there are posts from other members (or themselves) the User will be able to see this in the feed of that Herd. </p>
					<p>In the Explore page, the User will be able to search for new Herds that they would like to be a member of. This is assuming that the Herd is public, if it is private the User will have to be invited to join the Herd, or request for permission to join the Herd. Through the Explore page, the User will also be able to search for things like University, GameDay and External Herd feeds. These things are fairly self-explanatory, they are information related to a given University, GameDay scores and when the games are scheduled, etc. and information that has been posted outside of a Herd. The User will also be able to search the Emergency System, to find any emergencies in their area that they should avoid. </p>
					<p>Through our Event Handling System, we have the Calendar (explained above), Notification System and Study Hall feature. The User has the option to enable the Notification System, giving them updates on their Herds whether it is about new posts or changes to the Herd calendar. The Study Hall feature will enable students to schedule study hall hours within the Herd for their classes, allowing others to see it on the Herd calendar if other Users would like to join. Mentioned above there is also Payment, the User will be able to pay for events through Herds that are scheduled to the Herds calendar (that they have RSVPd for) through a secured payment system. </p>
					<p>Within a Herd, a User will be able to create a Direct or Group message with other members of their Herd. This can be done simply by pressing on a user’s display name and selecting the option to create a direct message. If the User would like to add other members to this chat, then they would also click on their display name and add them to the already created chat. If sending a message to a User that is not a member of your Herd then you would repeat the steps listed above, however the User that is receiving the message would need to accept this message. This is to ensure that the User is comfortable receiving a message from a User that they do not know.</p>
					<p>For certain features such as messaging, aspects of the Explore page and Event Handling System will utilize activity tracking. This will allow the User to see more content that they would like, ensuring the User has a pleasant experience when using Herds. Mentioned above, some aspects of Herds will be moderated to ensure that no inappropriate content slips through to dampen the Users experience. Herds will also be able to support iOS and Android devices, allowing people who own either device to utilize the app.</p>
